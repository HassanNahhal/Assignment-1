The WaterData object will come from the robot boat, and the information it gathers will need to be seen by several devices.  
In a case such as this, the observer pattern is appropriate to use because it is specifically designed for situations 
in which one data source that is updated is able to “push” those updates to multiple places.

To meet the requirement of people being able to have their own data acquisition displays and using 
them as pluggable components, the Adapter pattern is appropriate.  This pattern is specifically used in 
cases where a system has to send data to different outside systems that use it in their own individual ways.

One additional pattern that could be used is the Façade pattern, this is because a controller 
for the boat should be strictly controlled, and an opaque façade could help protect the system from 
other systems gaining unauthorized access.
